ðŸš¦ Embedded Traffic Light Control System
Project Overview

This project is an Embedded Systems simulation developed using Proteus 8 Professional.
It demonstrates a traffic light control system with multiple intersections, designed and controlled by a PIC16F877A microcontroller.

The system uses:

7-Segment Displays to show timers.

Traffic Light Modules (Red, Yellow, Green).

PIC16F877A Microcontroller as the main controller.

Push Buttons & Switches for manual input.

Resistors & Logic Gates (7447) for signal handling.

Features

Real-time traffic light sequencing.

Countdown display using 7-segment modules.

Multiple intersection management.

Fully simulated in Proteus.

Tools & Technologies

Proteus 8 Professional (circuit design & simulation).

Embedded C (MPLAB / MikroC) for microcontroller programming.

PIC16F877A microcontroller.

How to Run

Open the project in Proteus 8 Professional.

Load the .hex file into the PIC16F877A.

Run the simulation and observe the traffic light operation.

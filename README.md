🚦 Traffic Light Control System (Embedded Project)
📌 Overview

This project is an embedded systems simulation built using Proteus 8 Professional.
It demonstrates a traffic light control system for multiple intersections, controlled by a PIC16F877A microcontroller.

The design integrates both hardware components and embedded C programming, providing a practical example of how microcontrollers can be used in real-world traffic management systems.
